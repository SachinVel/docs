## Environmental Policy Integrated Climate Model

The Environmental Policy Integrated Climate **(EPIC)** model, originally known as the Erosion/Productivity Impact Calculator, is **designed to simulate a field, farm or small watershed**, that is homogenous in terms of climate, soil, land use, and topography. EPIC is capable of **simulating around eighty crops**. This model helps in analyzing the effects of management strategies on soil erosion and extends to other aspects of agricultural sustainability like water quality, crop yields, plant competition, and pest control.

Initially developed in the early 1980s, **(J. R. Williams,
Jones, & Dyke, 1984)**. EPIC integrated components from previous models such as CREAMS **(Knisel, 1980)** and SWRRB **(J. R. Williams, Nicks, & Arnold, 1985)**. The model was later enhanced with a pesticide component from GLEAMS **(Leonard, 1987)** to assess pesticide fate, further developed by **Sabbagh, Geleta, Elliott, Williams, & Griggs (1991)**. EPIC has evolved to address broader issues such as global climate change impacts, biomass production for energy, and landfill design, making it a versatile tool in environmental and agricultural management.
